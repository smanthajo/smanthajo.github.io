    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Namaste!
      I am Samantha, a devoted student of Ayurveda with a journey spanning a decade. My profound connection with Ayurveda began
      as a quest to holistic well-being and over the years, this ancient wisdom has become an integral part of my life.
      
      For the past 10 years, I've immersed myself in the profound teachings of Ayurveda, gradually weaving its principles into the
      fabric of my daily existence. This transformative journey has been a continuous exploration, guiding me toward a deeper
      understanding of the intricate dance between mind, body, and spirit.
      
      Fueling my journey is a dual passion: a fervor for teaching and a commitment to holistic health and wellness. As an Ayurvedic
      practitioner student, I am excited to share the timeless wisdom of Ayurveda with you, guiding you towards a balanced, vibrant life.
