<p><b>CONSULTATIONS AND TREATMENTS</b></p>
<br>
<p>
Consultations are nonrefundable. You have a 6-month window, starting from the time of purchase, to complete your consultation. We advise scheduling sooner rather than later, as appointment slots fill up quickly.
If you need to cancel or reschedule a consultation or treatment, please email us at least 72 hours before your appointment.
